# Introduction

## What is Cherub?

The Cherub Protocol is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-finance-defi)) inverse perpetuals protocol for [trading](/docs/about/terminology#trading), [bonding](/docs/about/terminology#bond) and [staking](/docs/about/terminology#stake). It runs on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network and is governed by a decentralized autonomous organization ([DAO](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao)).

This project is inspired by the [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) ([3, 3](/docs/about/terminology#(3,3))) incentive model for aligning users. While traders require deep liquidity, stakers have to lock up capital, and bonders can potentially [pump-and-dump](/docs/about/terminology#pump-and-dump), Cherub offers a unique solution to game theory's [prisoner's dilemma](/docs/about/terminology/#prisoners-dilemma) problem in the form of a virtual automated market maker ([vAMM](/docs/about/terminology#virtual-automated-market-maker-vamm)) decentralized exchange ([DEX](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-exchange-dex)) governed by a DAO via the [SERAPH](/docs/about/terminology#seraph) token. The DAO token is also responsible for managing the treasury, or protocol-owned liquidity.

Cherub relies on trading, bonding and staking. Trading is done using token collateral. Bonded token collateral receives [THRONES](/docs/about/terminology#thrones) tokens which are rewarded trading fees pro rata. Users may then stake THRONES tokens to receive [CHERUB](/docs/about/terminology#cherub) which are rewarded protocol fees pro rata.

## Why Cherub?

Cherub offers the best user experience for retail users. It does this through low trade fees, no minimum trade size, and quotes trading pairs in USD as [inverse perpetuals](/docs/inverse-perpetuals).
