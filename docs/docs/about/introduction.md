# Introduction

## What is Cherub?

Cherub is a decentralized finance ([DeFi](terminology.md#defi)) inverse perpetuals protocol for **trading**, **investing** and **building**. It runs on the [Solana](https://solana.com/) network and is governed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization ([DAO](terminology.md#dao)).

This project is inspired by [Olympus DAO's](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) ([3, 3](terminology.md#(3,3))) incentive model for aligning users. It offers a solution to game theory's Prisoner's Dilemma problem. While traders require deep liquidity, investors have to lock up capital, and builders can potentially pump and dump, Cherub offers a unique solution in the form of a unique virtual automated market maker ([AMM](terminology.md#amm)) decentralized exchange ([DEX](terminology.md#dex)) governed by a DAO.

The protocol relies on [staking](terminology.md#staking) and [bonding](terminology.md#bonding). It uses staked, or protocol-owned liquidity, in the form of a productive treasury to receive and distribute trading fees, while selling discounted protocol tokens via bonding.

## Why Cherub?

Centralized exchanges do not pass value on to users. Cherub attempts to solve this problem by not only being the most capital efficient inverse perpetuals DEX, but also aims to be the best protocol for traders, investors and builders in terms of low margins.
