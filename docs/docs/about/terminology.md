## AMM

Automated market maker. AMM's traditionally use a constant product function `x * y = k` to determine the invariant used for quoting.

## bank run

Also known as a "run on the bank", this occurs when a large enough number of users withdraw funds from the exchange because they believe the protocol will cease to operate in the near future. This is detrimental to fractional-reserve systems.

## bonding

Bonding is the process of lending an asset to the DEX for a certain amount of time in exchange for discounted protocol tokens.

## DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity controlled by a variety of computers, networks and nodes. It is not controlled by a single institution such as a government or central bank and hence cannot be censored.

## DEX

Decentralized exchange.

## DeFi

Decentralized finance as opposed to traditional or legacy finance. DeFi is also commonly referred to as "open finance".

## Index Price

The spot price of a given asset.

## Market Price

The current protocol market price for a given asset.

## OI

Open interest. This is the total number of unsettled contracts, or the outstanding value of the futures contracts.

## staking

This is akin to keeping your tokens in the protocol thereby preventing a bankrun. By staking protocol tokens, users help secure the network and earn rewards while doing so.
