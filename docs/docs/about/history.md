# History

At the end of 2020, computer programmer [Pindaroso](https://github.com/pindaroso) discovered inverse perpetual swap contracts. This lead to a brief trading affair.

> I remember first deciding to send some funny money to an exchange after hearing about perps from an old friend. Following a brief read of the charts, I placed my first buy limit order, post-only — long. It was quickly filled. The position PnL turned green, and after five minutes... the number was still going up. “That was fun”, I thought to myself as I exited the position. “Why bother programming when I can make cash like this?” I placed another long order, but with leverage. The position PnL turned red… and continued bleeding. "Dammit!" Jaw clenched, I panicked and exited. I had no clue what I was doing. But I needed to figure it out. I was hooked.

In September 2021, the Solana Ignition hackathon was announced, providing the perfect opportunity to innovate on exchange design while simultaneously getting to further explore a new piece of blockchain technology. The project was an experiment that combined concepts from [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) ([AMM](/docs/about/terminology#automated-market-maker-amm)) and [OlympusDAO](https://www.olympusdao.finance/) ([3, 3](/docs/about/terminology#3-3)). After receiving positive feedback from the hackathon submission, the Cherub Protocol has since become a full-time effort.
