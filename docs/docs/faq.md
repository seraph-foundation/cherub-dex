# FAQ

## What makes Cherub unique?

The Cherub Protocol is a perpetuals exchange focused on retail [traders](/docs/about/terminology#trade), [bonders](/docs/about/terminology#bond) and [stakers](/docs/about/terminology#stake). It is also the first inverse perpetuals market on Solana and features a uniquely integrated [vAMM](/docs/about/terminology#virtual-automated-market-maker-vamm) design featuring a dynamic liquidation engine based on bonding governed by a [DAO](/docs/about/terminology#decentralized-autonomous-organization-dao) ([3, 3](/docs/about/terminology#3-3)).

## Who runs Cherub?

Nobody. Cherub is governed by a DAO. All decisions are formed by community members on the forum and made by token holders through voting.

## Who is working on this?

The project was ideated by Pindaroso and is being built by a distributed pseudo-anonymous team.

## Who are our users?

Cherub users include traders, for example, individuals and institutions, bonders, like builders and protocols, and stakers, potentially individuals, institutions, builders and protocols.

The token does not produce rewards nor is this token expected to rise or fall in value. [CHRB](/docs/about/terminology#chrb) is a DAO token used to govern the protocol through proposal submission and voting.

## How does the sCHRB token produce rewards?

[sCHRB](/docs/about/terminology#schrb) produces rewards through [staking](/docs/about/terminology#stake). See [equations](/docs/protocol/equations) for more information.

## How does the bCHRB token produce rewards?

The [bCHRB](/docs/about/terminology#chrb) produces rewards by means of [bonding](/docs/about/terminology#bond). See [equations](/docs/protocol/equations) for more information.

## What is the purpose of the DAO treasury?

Cherub uses funding to support engineering and community management efforts.
