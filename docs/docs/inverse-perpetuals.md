# Inverse Perpetuals

## Liquidity Ex Nihilo

Perpetual future swap contracts are an incredible innovation. They enable counterparties to exchange pure risk for any asset. Even hard to price things, like indices. Valuing assets is a difficult problem which makes this particularly noteworthy. They offer institutional and retail investors, as well as traders, tax efficient, synthetic asset exposure, which in turn increases market liquidity. More liquidity leads to increased available leverage. Efficient price discovery, liquidity and leverage are all needed for a healthy market to form.

Unlike standard futures contracts, perpetuals never expire, existing in perpetuity. An interest rate, or funding, is exchanged between long and short positions in order to keep the market price of the derivative as close to the asset spot price as possible. Depending on how continuously funding is applied, perpetuals can be thought of as settled in real-time.

The modern form of perpetuals made popular by cryptocurrencies in 2016 is nothing new. Robert Shiller originally proposed the idea in 1993. Yet still, even his creation has ancestors. A perpetual is essentially an index swap, arguably a cousin of the equity linked swap. The primary difference being that an index swap only requires one leg of the multi-part trade to be an index. For example, this could simply be swapping an index for a portfolio of bonds settled in cash. An equity linked swap adds the additional constraint that the index leg finances the performance of the other leg using future cash flow. The cash flow could be something like dividends generated from a portfolio. This mechanism is similar to an interest rate swap using variable and fixed rates.

Cryptocurrency perpetuals are particularly interesting from an ecosystem point of view when one considers the past and potential future growth of the market. Traditional finance ([TradFi](/about/terminology.md#traditional-finance-tradfi)) markets consist of approximately $\$10{\ trillion}$ in capitalization, $\$100{\ trillion}$ in debt, and $\$1,000{\ trillion}$ in derivatives. Crypto markets have, at this time, about a $\$2{\ trillion}$ cap, $\$0.01{\ trillion}$ in debt, and $\$0.0001{\ trillion}$ in derivatives. If these ratios are maintained, the crypto derivatives market is looking at serious future growth. The current TradFi derivatives to capital ratio follows.

$$
\$1,000{\ trillion}\div\$10{\ trillion}=\$100{\ trillion}
$$

And the current crypto derivatives to capital ratio.

$$
\$0.0001{\ trillion}\div\$2{\ trillion}=\$0.00005{\ trillion}
$$

What would the predicted crypto derivatives market be if the TradFi ratio is maintained?

$$
\$2{\ trillion}\times\$100{\ trillion}=\$200{\ trillion}
$$

The derivatives growth potential big.

$$
\$200{\ trillion}\div\$0.0001{\ trillion}=2,000,000{x}
$$
